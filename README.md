# This is a Web-based Learning Management System website that uses Standard Based Grading. 

Web Framework: Flask  
Backend Functions: Python, Javascript

### HOW THE WEBSITE WORKS
- Create a teacher or student account by signing up
- Sign in using the email you used to create the account
- If your account is a teacher account you can:
    - Add/delete classes
    - Add/delete students (Adding/deleting a student will directly add/remove the class from the student's dashboard)
    - Add/delete assignments
- The teacher has access to all students in the database and when a new student account is created, this will show in
  the teacher's list of students they can add to one of their classes.
